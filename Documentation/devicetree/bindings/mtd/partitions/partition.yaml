title: Partition

description: |
  This binding describes a single flash partition. Each partition must have its
  relative offset and size specified. Depending on partition function extra
  properties can be used.

properties:
  reg:
    description: partition's offset and size within the flash
    maxItems: 1

  label:
    description: The label / name for this partition. If omitted, the label
      is taken from the node name (excluding the unit address).

  read-only:
    description: This parameter, if present, is a hint that this partition
      should only be mounted read-only. This is usually used for flash
      partitions containing early-boot firmware images or data which should
      not be clobbered.
    type: boolean

  lock:
    description: Do not unlock the partition at initialization time (not
      supported on all devices)
    type: boolean

  slc-mode:
    description: This parameter, if present, allows one to emulate SLC mode
      on a partition attached to an MLC NAND thus making this partition
      immune to paired-pages corruptions
    type: boolean

  encrypted:
    description: This parameter flags a partition as encrypted. All accesses
      to and from this partition will be encrypted/decrypted.
    type: boolean

  encryption-keyblob-size:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: Size in bytes of the encryption key blob defined above. The
      size of the key blob is the size of the key itself plus 48 bytes of blob
      overhead. The maximum key size is 64 bytes so the maximum key blob size
      is 112 bytes.

  encryption-keyblob-part:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: Partition number where the CAAM encrypted crypto key is
      stored. Defauls to 1.

  encryption-keyblob-offset:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: Offset in the encryption-keyblob-part where the CAAM
      encrypted crypto key is stored.
